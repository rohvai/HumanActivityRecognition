There are around billions of people who own smart phone. A modern smartphone has many different types of sensors. Among them the two most important sensors are accelerometer and gyroscope. These sensors are tri-axial sensors i.e. they give the readings on the X, Y and Z axes. Thus we have a total of six time series data. Our task in this project is to use the data generated by these two sensors in order to predict whether a person is Sitting, Standing, Laying down, walking upstairs or walking down stairs or just walking normally.

Why is this useful?
Modern smart watches like fitbit or apple watch have such sensors. These devices help us monitor our personal health by telling us the number of hours one slept, the number of calories burnt, number of steps walked, time spent sitting etc. These devices need to know the activity the person is doing.

Metrics Used:
1) Accuracy
2) Confusion Matrix
3) Multi-class logloss
